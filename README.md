# ShinyApp
Shiny App class project for Data Products course offered at Coursera by JHU
Only Ui and Server codes are added. The folder on the desktop had an additional shinyApps folder
which was not added to the master at Github. To use these files to launch your own hosted version,
you need to install the shiny package for R and follow steps in a ShinyApps tutorial.
